Description: An R package providing an efficient sparse numeric vector class with
    arithmetic operations, statistical methods, and standardization capabilities.
    The sparse representation stores only non-zero values and their positions,
    enabling memory-efficient computations on large vectors with many zeros.
    This package includes methods for basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *),
    statistical functions (mean, norm, standardize), and utility functions
    (sparsity, cross product). Designed for SDS 375 Statistical Programming course.
